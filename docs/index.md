# Welcome to Qseek ðŸ”¥

Qseek is an earthquake detection and localisation framework. It combines modern **machine learning phase detection and robust migration and stacking techniques**.

The detector is leveraging [Pyrocko](https://pyrocko.org) and [SeisBench](https://github.com/seisbench/seisbench), it is highly-performant and can search massive data sets for seismic activity efficiently.
