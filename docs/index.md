# Welcome to Lassie üêï‚Äçü¶∫

Lassie is an earthquake detection and localisation framework. It combines modern **machine learning phase detection and robust migration and stacking techniques**.

The detector is leveraging [Pyrocko](https://pyrocko.org) and [SeisBench](https://github.com/seisbench/seisbench), it is highly-performant and can scan massive data sets efficiently.

*Seismic swarm activity at Iceland, Reykjanes Peninsula during a 2020 unrest. 15,000+ earthquakes detected, outlining a dike intrusion, preceeding the 2021 Fagradasfjall eruption. Visualized in [Pyrocko Sparrow](https://pyrocko.org).*
