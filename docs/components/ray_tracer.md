# Ray Tracers

The calculation of seismic travel times is a cornerstone for the migration and stacking approach. Lassie supports different ray tracers for travel time calculation, which can be adapted for different geological settings.

## Constant Velocity

The constant velocity models is trivial and follows

$$
t_{P} = \frac{d}{v_P}
$$

## 1D Layered Model

The 1D ray tracer is based on [Pyrocko Cake](https://pyrocko.org/docs/current/apps/cake/manual.html#command-line-examples).

## 3D Velocity Model

We implement the fast marching method for calculating first arrivals of waves in 3D volumes.

For quality check, all 3D velocity models are exported to `vtk/` folder as `.vti` files. Use [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) to inspect and explore the velocity models.
