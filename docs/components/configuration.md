# Lassie Configuration

At center is a JSON configuration file which is parsed by [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/). The following pages will detail how to setup this JSON file for the search.

Also see the [getting started guide](../getting_started.md) for a brief introduction into the CLI.

[General configuration conventions](general.md) are outlines in this guide as well.

## The Search

The search configuration. **This is the entrypoint for the EQ detection and localisation**.
More information on the submodules (e.g. Octree, Data Provider and other) can be found on subpages in the navigation.

```python exec='on'
from lassie.utils import generate_docs
from lassie.search import Search

print(generate_docs(Search()))
```

## Minimal Config

This is a minimal config which can used to start a Lassie search.

## Structure

Structure of the search and optimisation of the octree, which is focusing in on seismic energy.
