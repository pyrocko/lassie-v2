Qseek is a data-driven earthquake detection and localisation framework for large seismic data sets. The framework is based on a stacking and migration approach, a beamforming method. It combines neural network phase annotations with an iterative octree localisation approach for efficient and accurate localisation of seismic events.

Key features are of the earthquake detection and localisation framework are:

* Earthquake phase detection using machine-learning model from [SeisBench](https://github.com/seisbench/seisbench), pre-trained on different data sets.
  * [PhaseNet (Zhu and Beroza, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggy423)
  * [EQTransformer (Mousavi et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17591-w)
  * [OBSTransformer (Niksejel and Zahng, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggae049)
  * LFEDetect
* Octree localisation approach for efficient and accurate search
* Different velocity models:
  * Constant velocity
  * 1D Layered velocity model
  * 3D fast-marching velocity model (NonLinLoc compatible)
* Extraction of earthquake event features:
  * Local magnitudes (ML), different attenuation models
  * Moment Magnitudes (MW) based on modelled peak ground motions
  * Different ground motion attributes (e.g. PGA, PGV, ...)
* Automatic extraction of modelled and picked travel times
* Station Corrections
  * station specific corrections (SST)
  * source specific station corrections (SSST)

Qseek is built on top of [Pyrocko](https://pyrocko.org).
